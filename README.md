# 4-Bit Designs ALU

A collection of 4-bit ALU designs exploring contrasting architectural philosophies, from a minimalist NAND‑universal implementation to a more advanced carry‑lookahead architecture. The first design is a hardware‑minimalist ALU, built entirely with discrete ICs, real wiring, and breadboards. It demonstrates how complete arithmetic and logic behavior can emerge from simple components using NAND universality and ripple‑carry techniques. The second design is a more complete and high‑performance ALU, featuring carry‑lookahead logic (CLA) and additional dedicated logic blocks.

# Hardware-Minimalist 4-bit ALU (Ripple-Carry Architecture)
This ALU represents the most fundamental version of the project: a design built entirely from discrete logic ICs, assembled by hand using breadboards, wiring, and basic digital components. The core idea is to show how a complete arithmetic and logic system can emerge from a minimal set of building blocks, following the principles of NAND universality and simple ripple-carry computation.

At its heart, this design implements a 4-bit ripple-carry adder, where each bit calculates its sum and pass its carry to the next stage. While not the fastest architecture, its transparency makes it highly educational: every step of the computation from XOR-based addition to AND-driven carry generation is physically observable in the circuit.

Beyond addition and subtraction, the ALU includes a NAND-based logic path to highlight how a single universal gate can serve as the foundation for more complex operations. The result is a compact but fully functional ALU that exemplifies hardware minimalism, discrete logic design, and hands-on digital engineering.

### Construction Tips
1. Start with power distribution (VCC and GND rails)
2. Implement full adder for one bit first, then replicate bottom-up
3. Test each operation individually before full integration
4. Use consistent color coding for signals

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Propagation Delay**: Ripple-carry design limits maximum speed
2. **Limited Operations**: Only 3 hardware operations
3. **No Overflow Flag**: Signed overflow detection not implemented
4. **Manual Testing**: Requires external input/output devices

# Advanced 4-Bit ALU (Carry-Lookahead Architecture)

After the hand-wired model, a second version was engineered using **Carry-Lookahead Logic (CLA)** to dramatically reduce propagation delay. In a ripple-carry adder, each bit must wait for the previous carry — limiting speed.

## Technical Specifications
Instead of letting each bit wait for the previous carry, the CLA computes all carries in parallel using the classical Generate and Propagate signals:

- Gi = AND(Ai, Bi)
- Pi = XOR(Ai, Bi)

From these, every carry is derived combinationally:

- C1 = OR( G0, AND(P0, Cin) )
- C2 = OR( G1, AND(P1, G0), AND(P1, P0, Cin) )
- C3 = OR( G2, AND(P2, G1), AND(P2, P1, G0), AND(P2, P1, P0, Cin) )
- C4 = OR( G3, AND(P3, G2), AND(P3, P2, G1), AND(P3, P2, P1, G0), AND(P3, P2, P1, P0, Cin) )

### Benefits of the CLA Design
- Much faster than ripple-carry  
- All carries computed in one combinational layer  
- More scalable (easy to extend to 8 or 16 bits)  

### Additional Logic Operations Added
The new Architecture also adds three independent logic blocks:

- **NAND**  
- **NOR**  
- **XNOR**  

Each implemented with its own dedicated combinational network, separate from the CLA path — similar to real CPU ALU designs.

### FPGA-Oriented Implementation
While it is *possible* to build this version with discrete chips, it would require a large number of ICs, making it better suited for FPGA synthesis.  
This "Advanced ALU" will be implemented once the FPGA board arrives :3
